Book List with Embedded PDFs
This project is a simple HTML-based website that displays a list of books in a table. Clicking on a book's name navigates to a separate page where the user can read the PDF of the selected book directly on the webpage.

Features
Responsive Table of Books: A table on the main page (index.html) lists books with their names, authors, and publication years.
Navigation: Clicking on a book name navigates to a dedicated page for that book.
Embedded PDFs: Each book page contains an embedded PDF reader, allowing users to read the book directly on the page.

Adding More Books
